Neurology May 1997 48:10S-16S) which is used to assess the severity of an individual's neuropathic behaviors based on a observations made by the patient's caregiver. This instrument contains 12 neuropsychiatric areas associated with dementia such as delusions, anxiety, motor disturbances, and appetite. Each behavior is evaluated only if the individual displays the behavior. For these behaviors, the frequency is assessed on a scale of 0-4 with 0 being occasionally and 4 being very frequently, the severity is assessed on a scale of 1-3 with 1 being mild and 3 being marked, and the level of distress each behavior inflicts on the caregiver is assessed on a scale of 0-5 with 0 being not distressing and 5 being extremely distressing.",Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire EXACT|Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire EXACT|NPI EXACT|NPI-Q EXACT|NPI1 EXACT,Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Questionnaire (NPI-Q),,NPISCORE,,,,,NPISCORE,No total score.,,,,No total score.,,,,,,,,,Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Questionnaire  0-36,
